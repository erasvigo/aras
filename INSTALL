Basic installation
------------------

1. Unpack the distribution tarball:

        $ tar xvzf aras-<version>.tar.gz
        $ cd aras-<version>

2. Change to the directory containing the unpacked source code:

        $ cd aras-<version>

3. Compile the full package:

        $ make

4. Optionally, you can compile a single binary:

        $ make daemon
        $ make player
        $ make recorder

5. Install binaries, data and documentation. This step may require root
   privileges:

        $ make install

6. In addition, you can create deb packages for 64 bit x86 machines:

        $ make deb-pkg

7. Optionally, you can create a single deb package:

        $ make deb-pkg-common
        $ make deb-pkg-daemon
        $ make deb-pkg-player
        $ make deb-pkg-recorder

8. Remove object files and binaries:

        $ make clean

9. Optionally, you can uninstall binaries, data and documentation. This step may
   require root privileges:

        $ make uninstall

Consider that may be neccessary to install previously the required dependencies
in your system:

        glib-2.0
        gstreamer-1.0
        gtk+-3.0

In addition, may be neccesary to install the needed GStreamer plugins in order
to play the required formats.

Advanced installation
---------------------

If you want to generate deb packages for architectures different than 64 bit x86,
rename subdirectories in debian directory and modify control files in them.
