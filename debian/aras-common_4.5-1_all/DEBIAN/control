Description: A Radio Automation System - common files
 ARAS is a suite of programs for a radio automation system.
 Some ARAS features are:
 * It reads a large number of media formats.
 * It can play files or media streams over internet.
 * Highly configurable.
 * Log file capability.
 * Time signal capability.
 * Interval signal capability.
 * It works with single file blocks, playlist blocks, blocks of random files, block of one random file and interleaved blocks.
 * Fade out capability.
 .
 There are 4 Debian packages from ARAS: aras-common, aras-daemon, aras-player and aras-recorder.
 aras-common contains the common files, aras-daemon contains the radio automation system without graphical interface, aras-player contains the radio automation system with graphical interface and aras-recorder contains an audio recorder with graphical interface.
 .
 The packages gstreamer1.0-plugins-base, gstreamer1.0-plugins-good and
 gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly are required for playing the ogg format, internet streams and mp3 support respectively. They pull X dependencies to aras-daemon but we can't avoid them.
