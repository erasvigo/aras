Simple station example
----------------------

This directory contains the required files for running a simple radio
station in the background.

It uses the ARAS radio automation system daemon aras-daemon, the JACK audio
server daemon jackd, the media converter ffmpeg, the broadcast streaming client
ices2 and the JACK port connection manager jack-plumbing.
