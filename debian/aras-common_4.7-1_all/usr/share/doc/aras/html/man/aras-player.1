ARAS-PLAYER(1)                                                  ARAS-PLAYER(1)



NAME
       aras-player - A Radio Automation System.

DESCRIPTION
       aras-player  is the main program for ARAS, the Radio Automation System,
       that plays the files or streams as scheduled in the config files.

       This is the program that has  a  GUI  interface  (in  GTK+).  There  is
       another  program  with  the  same  capabilities  but without a GUI, the
       aras-daemon (see aras-daemon(1) man page).

       In your system may have both aras-player.sh and aras-player. The  first
       should  be  a shell script for call the second in a proper way (passing
       the proper config file).

OPTIONS
       There is only a option for call the aras-player binary file, its config
       file (aras.conf).
