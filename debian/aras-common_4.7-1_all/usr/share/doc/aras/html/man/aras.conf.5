NAME
       aras.conf - Configuration file for ARAS - A Radio Automation System.

DESCRIPTION
       aras.conf  is  the configuration file for ARAS. These are the file con‐
       figuration tags:

OPTIONS
       The ARAS configuration file contains comments and some commands, one of
       them in each line:


       Lines with a # character at the beginning are comments.


       ConfigurationPeriod value
              Defines  the period in miliseconds for configuration update, for
              example:

              ConfigurationPeriod 10000


       ScheduleFile my_schedule_file_path
              Defines the current schedule file.  Quotation  marks  should  be
              used if my_schedule_file_path contains whitespaces.


       BlockFile my_block_file_path
              Defines  the  current  block  description  file. Quotation marks
              should be used if my_block_file_path contains whitespaces.


       LogFile my_log_file_path
              Defines the current log file. Quotation marks should be used  if
              my_log_file_path contains whitespaces.


       EnginePeriod value

       ScheduleMode schedule_mode
              Defines the behaviour of the scheduler. schedule_mode  parameter
              can take some values:

              hard in order to set an inflexible scheduler.
              soft in order to set a flexible scheduler.


       DefaultBlockMode default_block_mode
              Defines  the default block behaviour. default_block_mode parame‐
              ter can take some values:

              off in order to disable the default block support.
              on in order to enable the default block support.

              If default_block_mode is on, the default block is played when  a
              block finishes before the beginning of the next block.


       DefaultBlock my_default_block
              Defines the default block, for example:

              FadeOutTime 2000


       TimeSignalMode time_signal_mode
              Defines  the  time  signal  mode. time_signal_mode parameter can
              take some values:

              off in order to disable time signal support.
              hour in order to define hourly time signal support.
              half in order to define hourly and half past  time  signal  sup‐
              port.


       TimeSignalBlock my_time_signal_file_block
              Defines the time signal block, for example:

              TimeSignalBlock my_time_signal_block

              Quotation  marks should be used if my_time_signal_block contains
              whitespaces.


       TimeSignalAdvance my_time_signal_advance_value
              Defines the advancement of time signal block, for example:

              TimeSignalAdvance 5000

       BlockPlayerAudioOutput block_player_audio_output
              Defines  the  GStreamer  audio  sink  for  the   block   player,
              block_player_audio_output parameter can take at least these val‐
              ues:

              auto
              pulseaudio
              alsa
              jack

              oss4
              openal
              file

              If block_player_audio_output is jack, the audio output  is  dis‐
              connected  by  default at the beginning of each loaded file. You
              should manage JACK connections externally.

              In the same way, if block_player_audio_output is file, the audio
              output  may  be disconnected by default at the beginning of each
              loaded file. You may manage pipelines externally.


       BlockPlayerAudioDevice block_player_audio_device
              Defines  the  block  player  audio  device  depending   on   the
              block_player_audio_output value and the system configuration.

              If  block_player_audio_output  is  jack,  it  defines  the  JACK
              server, for example:

              If block_player_audio_output is  file,  it  defines  the  output
              file, for example:

              BlockPlayerAudioDevice "/dev/stdout"

              This allows to deliver an audio stream to other application, for
              example:

              aras-daemon aras.conf | aplay -c 2 -f S16_LE  -r 48000

              Obviously, it is possible to use named pipes:

              BlockPlayerAudioDevice "my_pipe"

              This allows to deliver an audio stream to other application, for
              example:

              aras-daemon  aras.conf  &  tail -f -n +1 my_pipe | aplay -c 2 -f
              S16_LE  -r 48000

              Defines the GStreamer audio sink for  the  time  signal  player,
              time_signal_player_audio_output  parameter  can  take  at  least
              these values:

              auto
              pulseaudio
              alsa
              jack

              oss4
              openal

              If time_signal_player_audio_output is jack, the audio output  is
              disconnected  by  default  at the beginning of each loaded file.
              You should manage JACK connections externally.

              In the same way, if time_signal_player_audio_output is file, the
              audio  output may be disconnected by default at the beginning of
              each loaded file. You should manage pipelines externally.

              This allows to deliver an audio stream to other application, for
              example:

              aras-daemon aras.conf | aplay -c 2 -f S16_LE  -r 48000

              Obviously, it is possible to use named pipes:
