NAME
       aras-recorder - A Radio Automation System.

DESCRIPTION

       defined blocks in the ARAS configuration. This program has a GUI inter‐
       face (in GTK+).

       In  your  system  may have both aras-recorder.sh and aras-recorder. The
       first should be a shell script for call the  second  in  a  proper  way

       fig file (aras.conf).
