NAME
       aras-daemon - A Radio Automation System.

DESCRIPTION
       aras-daemon  is  the  ARAS  program  that plays the files or streams as
       scheduled in the config files, but whitout a GUI  interface.  There  is
       another  program with the same capabilities but with a X GUI (in GTK+):
       aras (see aras(1) man page).

       In your system may have both aras-daemon.sh and aras-daemon. The  first
       should  be  a shell script for call the second in a proper way (passing
       the proper config file).
