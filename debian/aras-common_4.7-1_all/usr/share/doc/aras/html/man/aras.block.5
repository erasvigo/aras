       tem.

DESCRIPTION
       aras.block The ARAS block description file contains the blocks descrip‐
       tions for ARAS.

OPTIONS
       The  ARAS  block  file contains comments and some block definition ele‐
       ments, one of them in each line:


       Lines with a # character at the beginning are comments.


       A block element is defined in a line as follows:

              Name    Type    Data


       Where:


       Name is the name of the block, as defined in the aras.schedule file.


       Type is the block type, it can be: File, Playlist,  Random,  Randomfile
       or Interleave.

              If  the block type is File, ARAS will play the file whose URI is
              defined in Data.

              If the block type is Playlist, ARAS will play the  m3u  playlist
              file defined in Data.

              If  the  block  type is Random, ARAS will play random files from
              the directory defined in Data.

              If the block type is Randomfile, ARAS will play  a  random  file
              from the directory defined in Data.

              If  the  block  type  is  Interleave, ARAS will play interleaved
              files from the blocks defined in Data according to  the  numeric
              parameters defined in Data.


       Data is the block data. It can contain a file URI (both local
              (file://)  or  from  internet (http://)), a m3u playlist path, a
              directory path, or the interleaving options,  depending  on  the
              type of block. Quotation marks should be used if block data con‐
              tains spaces.


       Examples of a block definition are:

              my_block  File  file:///home/radio/archive/my_program.ogg

              my_block  Playlist  /home/radio/archive/my_playlist.m3u

              my_block  Random  /home/radio/archive/

              my_block  Randomfile  /home/radio/archive/
